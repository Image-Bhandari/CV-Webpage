      <h3> GROUP WORK AND MY CHOICE </h3>
      <p>Though we did it on our own but we had conversation about how can we solve particular problems. Which helped us to gain various ideas to crack a single problem. Group discussion of that limit was very fruitful as it helped every one to know more breifly about the provided assignment.
In my mind, I thought to firstly see the exsisting websites which are available for reference and to start making in my own view. I thought to add animations, hover, navigations, footer ,various divisions, etc in my page to make it more attractive. I choosed a different type of font than that of normal day use. Hence the work was more easy by doing so.</p>

  <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>the project taught us various things. It taught us group work, thinking in a creative way, making our work free of errors,etc. The project is now completed with fulfillment of criteria and with very much effort as the time provided was short so there was not much time to know new codes to implement in the project. Also, other module assignments too hampered the project. Thinking positively, this project will also help me in the future and make me be a successful web developer.  you can also find my pages on github on the following link <br> https://9818049447.github.io/CV/ <br></p>
